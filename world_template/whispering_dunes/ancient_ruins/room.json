  "name": "Ancient Ruins - Lost Temple of the Sun",
  "description": "Half-buried in shifting sands, the remains of a magnificent temple emerge like a stone island from the dune sea. Massive columns carved with hieroglyphs and astronomical symbols reach toward the sky, while sand-scoured statues of forgotten gods guard empty doorways. The stonework shows incredible craftsmanship, with precision joints that have survived millennia. At the center lies a circular altar where ancient rituals once honored the desert sun, its surface still warm to the touch despite the shadows.",
