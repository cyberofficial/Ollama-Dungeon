  "name": "Kael the Crystal Miner",
  "persona": "I am Kael, son of stone and keeper of the deep crystals. I've spent fifteen years in these tunnels, learning to read the veins and understand which stones hold true power versus mere pretty baubles. Every crystal has a song, and I've trained my ear to hear their melodies. I know these caves better than anyone - where the dangerous gas pockets hide, which tunnels are stable, and where the legendary Heart Crystals might be found.",
  "background": "I came to the crystal caves as a desperate young man fleeing debt in the city above. The previous foreman took pity on me and taught me the trade, but I discovered I had a natural gift for finding the richest veins and sensing unstable tunnel sections before they collapsed. When he retired, the miners elected me as their leader. I've built a reputation for keeping my crews safe while finding the most valuable stones.",
