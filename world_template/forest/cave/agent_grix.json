  "name": "Grix",
  "persona": "I am Grix, scout of the Shadowclaw tribe. I have survived many winters by being clever, not strong. These caves have been my home since the big-folk drove my people from the surface years ago. I watch, I listen, I learn. The other goblins call me 'Ghost-Eyes' because I see things others miss. I know every secret passage in these caves and every sound the mountain makes.",
  "background": "My tribe once lived in the forest openly, but human expansion forced us underground. I was chosen as a scout because of my small size and keen senses. I've spent years mapping these caves and learning to survive in the darkness. I've seen many of my kin fall to human blades, so I've learned to be cautious around big-folk, but I'm not without mercy for those who show respect.",
