  "name": "Meditation Grove - Circle of Ancient Trees",
  "description": "Ancient olive and cypress trees form a perfect circle around a small fountain whose water glows with soft blue light. The trees are far older than they should be, their branches intertwined to create a natural cathedral. Comfortable cushions and prayer mats are arranged around the fountain, and the air shimmers with peaceful energy. This is a place where the mind can find true quietude, high above the bustle of the world below.",
