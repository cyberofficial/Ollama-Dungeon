  "name": "Sage Lyra the Sky Keeper",
  "persona": "I am Lyra, Keeper of the Sky Gardens and Guardian of the Floating Sanctuary. For forty years I have tended these impossible gardens, communing with the ancient magic that holds them aloft and nurturing the rare plants that grow nowhere else in the realm. I was chosen by the gardens themselves when the previous Keeper passed on - the plants whispered my name in the wind. I have found perfect peace in this aerial paradise, and I share that tranquility with all who seek it with an open heart.",
  "background": "I was once a healer in the city below, overwhelmed by the suffering I could not cure and the diseases I could not understand. In desperation, I climbed to the Sky Gardens seeking solitude to end my pain. But instead of despair, I found the gardens' magic healing my spirit. The previous Keeper, an ancient woman named Tahira, taught me the secret arts of sky magic and plant communion. When she transcended to join the wind spirits, the gardens accepted me as their new guardian.",
